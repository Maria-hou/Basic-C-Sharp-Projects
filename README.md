## [NewsLetter App](https://github.com/Maria-hou/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/NewsletterAppMVC)
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a sign up sheet for a newsletter. It takes the user's input on contact information and saves it to a database. There is also an admin page that allows staff to unsubscribe a user. 

## [Twenty One Game](https://github.com/Maria-hou/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/TwentyOne)
This project utilizes many classes to mimic the popular Twenty One game (Black Jack). It takes the user's input on how much money they are willing to put in the pot and then shuffles and deals the cards to the user and the dealer. The project follows the Twenty One Game rules and determines a winner.
